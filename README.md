# Chess_result
You can enter your chess.com username and your opponent's username and start date and click on search then you will see the score of all the decisive game between you two in the last month and also the total score till date. To do this project i have used chess.com api and got all the games of username inputed then i searched for the specific game with the opponent's username then extracted the result of the game and according to it i have increased the score of the players. Also to make it easy to excess i have build all of this in javascript and then build a webpage of it for good user experience.
